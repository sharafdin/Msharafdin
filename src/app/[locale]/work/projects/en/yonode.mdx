## **Overview**

**Yonode** is an open-source Node.js library that I developed to streamline the initial setup and configuration process for backend applications. It serves as a starter toolkit specifically for **Express.js** projects, enabling developers to save time and focus on creating application features rather than repetitive setup tasks.

### **What is Yonode?**
Yonode is a toolkit designed to address the challenges developers face when starting new Node.js projects. It provides pre-built templates, folder structures, and configurations for common backend requirements such as database connectivity, authentication, and middleware integrations.

With support for **JavaScript** and upcoming **TypeScript**, Yonode simplifies backend development while promoting best practices and scalability.

### **Inspiration**
The idea for Yonode was born out of my personal frustration with the repetitive steps involved in setting up new Node.js or Express.js projects. Each project required starting from scratch, which was both time-consuming and inefficient. Yonode solves this problem by providing a boilerplate to kickstart Express.js development efficiently.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Pre-Built Templates**
- Fully-configured starter templates for **Express.js**.
- Options for **Auth** or **NoAuth** setups.
- Scaffolding includes:
  - **MVC Folder Structure**
  - Pre-configured **environment variables**
  - Essential middleware (e.g., logging, error handling, session management).

### 2. **Dual-Language Support**
- **JavaScript**: Supported templates for various database configurations.
- **TypeScript**: Coming soon in **v1.5.0** for improved type safety.

### 3. **Database Configurations**
- Choose from popular databases:
  - **MongoDB** (Mongoose, Prisma, TypeORM)
  - **MySQL** (Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM)
  - **PostgreSQL** (Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM)

### 4. **Authentication Options**
- Pre-built **authentication flows** (login, registration) for secure backend setups.

### 5. **Middleware Integration**
- Includes ready-to-use middleware for:
  - Request parsing
  - Error handling
  - Logging

## **How Yonode Works**

### **Step-by-Step Usage**
1. **Install Yonode**:
   ```bash
   npx yonode@latest
   ```

2. **Select Your Project Type**:
   - JavaScript or TypeScript (TypeScript coming soon).

3. **Choose Your Database and ORM**:
   - MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
   - Supported ORMs: Mongoose, Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM.

4. **Authentication**:
   - Decide whether you need pre-configured authentication flows.

5. **Start Building**:
   - Your project is ready with a clean, scalable structure!

## **Technical Challenges & Solutions**

### **Challenge 1: Flexibility Across Databases**
Supporting multiple databases (SQL and NoSQL) with popular ORMs was critical. Yonode includes pre-configured setups for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, allowing developers to focus on building features.

### **Challenge 2: Scalability of Project Structure**
To ensure scalability, Yonode adopts an **MVC folder structure** that promotes clean code separation and long-term maintainability.

### **Challenge 3: Developer Experience**
The guided installation process ensures that developers can easily set up their backend without diving into complex configurations.

---

## **Impact**

- **Efficiency**: Reduced setup time by up to **70%** for backend projects.
- **Adoption**: Yonode is already being used by developers in open-source projects and private applications.
- **Community**: As an open-source library, Yonode fosters collaboration and learning for new and experienced developers alike.

---

## **Future Roadmap**

1. **TypeScript Support (v1.5.0)**:
   - Enhanced developer experience with type safety and better IDE support.

2. **CLI Enhancements**:
   - Add more customization options during project setup.

3. **Additional Database Support**:
   - Include templates for other popular databases (e.g., SQLite, MariaDB).

4. **Plugin Ecosystem**:
   - Allow developers to add plugins for features like GraphQL APIs or advanced logging.
